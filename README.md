# express-login-system
A fully functional login authentication system. You can register in this app as well as log in/out. I've been learning node/express as well as back end fundamentals so this was just a little play around project to get a functioning register/login system working and understand how things work under the hood. There's probably alot of little things I did wrong but hey, it works lol. Now to fine tune it :)
